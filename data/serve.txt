    In badminton, the serve must be hit in
 an upwards direction, with an underarm
hitting action. You are not allowed to play
 a tennis style serve. The main rule here 
is that when you hit the shuttle, it must 
be below  your  waist. In other words, you 
can serve from a little higher than the top
 of your shorts, but not much.
